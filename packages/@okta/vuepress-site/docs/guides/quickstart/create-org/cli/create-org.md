Creating an org is easy using the [Okta CLI](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli).

After installing the Okta CLI, enter `okta register`.

You are prompted to supply the information required:

 - First name
 - Last name
 - Email address
 - Company

After creating your org, the CLI returns your Org URL, also known as your Okta domain, and let you know that an activation email has been sent to you.
